### My name's Ricky Romero.

I'm a designer and engineer in the scenic Bay Area of California. I've worked in web design and development (mobile and desktop) for over 15 years, and I'm dipping my toes in Swift and WebGL now. I've designed for both product and marketing teams, and done both visual and interaction design. I've also written product and marketing code for use in production.

I've produced my best work in roles leveraging both my design and engineering talents. However, I can specialize in design only when needed.

In my spare time I like to take photos, build small hobby projects, and play video games (Nintendo for life).
