### My name's Ricky Romero.

I'm a designer and engineer in the scenic Bay Area of California. I've worked in web design and development (mobile and desktop) for over 10 years, and I'm dipping my toes in Swift and WebGL now. I've designed for both product and marketing teams, and done both visual and interaction design. I've also written product and marketing code for use in production.

I've produced my best work in roles leveraging both my design and engineering talents. That said, I understand that's an uncommon role, and can specialize in design when needed.

I'm open to both hybrid and remote work. Hybrid roles must be located south of Burlingame or Hayward.

In my spare time I like to take photos, build small hobby projects, and play video games (Nintendo for life).
