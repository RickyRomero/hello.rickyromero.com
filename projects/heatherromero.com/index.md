[My partner Heather](https://heatherromero.com/) is a talented designer and illustrator. She'd wanted to remake her portfolio for a long time, and when it finally came time to do so, I helped her out in limited ways.

### Code

Heather's skilled at writing HTML and Sass, so she didn't need as much of my help there. But, since PHP and JavaScript aren't as easy to write, and her portfolio uses a fair bit of both, I helped out with the heavier coding challenges.

Some of Heather's portfolio is built with [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) for its ease of implementation. The project grid is filtered and sorted using [Isotope](https://isotope.metafizzy.co/), and [Slick](https://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/) handles media carousels as shown on mobile devices.

The lightbox component I built uses the `history.pushState()` API to update the page URL when you open and close a project. It pulls the project content from a separate standalone page that's available when you visit said URL directly. And, of course, you can close the lightbox with the Escape key, as well as by clicking the back button.

I also built the project tiles to have a simple effect when you mouse over them. They show different preview images depending on how far left or right you move the cursor.

Finally, I wrote some JavaScript and PHP to fetch her artwork posts from Tumblr, and prevent automated spambots from annoying her through her contact form.

### Design

I acted in solely an advisory capacity on the design of Heather's portfolio. Heather explored lots of different approaches for her redesign, from staid to wild. I encouraged her to pursue a more expressive approach in the design, since she needed to stand out from a crowded field. I also coached her on how to write about her projects, helping her rewrite things more concisely.

Heather's talents and portfolio were successful in landing her positions at [Rambus](https://www.rambus.com/) in 2017, and at [Intuitive](https://www.intuitive.com/) in 2019.
