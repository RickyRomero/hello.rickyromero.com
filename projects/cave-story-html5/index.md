Cave Story is a hit indie title by one developer: Daisuke Amaya. I enjoy the game's blend of exploration and action gameplay.

In September 2011, I was itching for a new hobby project, and web browsers supported a lot of stuff. WebGL, Web Audio, gamepads and more made games a real possibility on the web platform.

I found an independent clone of Cave Story's game engine called NXEngine, written in C++. So, I decided to try to get it working in a web browser!

I learned a lot of things working on this project. I had to port tens of thousands of lines of C++ to JavaScript. This was also the first time I used WebGL, and the first time I synthesized audio. I'd never worked with game loops or scripting systems before either.

After months of work in my spare time, the game was playable from the beginning right up to the end credits.

I aimed to deliver a flawless port of Cave Story for the web platform that fans could enjoy anytime, without installing it. A port which showed off the raw capabilities and performance of web browsers. A port which you could run on a laptop without spinning the fans up.

The final result speaks for itself. Even in 2012, the game ran at a flawless 60 frames per second even on a modest system. And, thanks to huge leaps in mobile performance, it's possible to play it on some unexpected hardware...

I loved working on this project, because it taught me about tons of software engineering concepts and challenges. So, do you have a moonshot project like this? [Please get in touch!](contact-cta)
