When I designed these pages, the UI aesthetic on phones was quite different. Apps tended to use lots of gradients, along with glossy and textured materials. At the time, I felt it was important for Intuit's first mobile site to reflect these trends so that it would feel as though it was designed specifically for your device.

I was also obsessed with mobile best practices, like being choiceful and intentional about the information onscreen, and sizing tap targets appropriately. I took this so seriously that I would regularly correct my colleagues to say "tap," "touch," or "press" instead of "clicking" on things in a touchscreen design.

It was also important for me to have elements on the page "peek" from the edge of the screen or container. I used this affordance a lot to tell users they could scroll, swipe, or rotate the device to see more.

Following a large redesign to the marketing pages for Intuit's small business offerings, I was tapped to overhaul the design and information architecture for Intuit's homepage.

I pushed hard for designs where the navbar was two lines high. This was a hard challenge because we had to communicate a lot up there. It's easy to go overboard with the number of links at the top of the page, so I pressed the team to be intentional and choose only the most important links for the header.

Intuit was also in the middle of transforming its brand to a "branded house." This meant that we had to tie our cornerstone products to the Intuit brand to increase the parent brand's recognition. (People knew TurboTax, but not Intuit.) I solved this in an elegant way by simply including favicon-sized icons in the header alongside the product name, and aligning them next to the Intuit logo. It looks a bit different today, but the same idea endures in Intuit's branding 8 years later.

At the time, responsive design was a pretty new practice, though it had a lot of promise. I wanted to make sure the new homepage would scale and adapt to whatever device you happened to visit on.

Brad Smith, who was our CEO at the time, announced these changes to the Intuit homepage at the company's 2013 Leadership Conference.

I carried through some of my previous work on the Intuit mobile site to bring community aspects to intuit.com. We added user forums and blog content for our various products to the site in a dedicated section.
