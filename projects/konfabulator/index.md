Here's a gallery of the widgets I built while I was on the team:

- Acura RDX Traffic
- Backyard
- Comment Killer
- FareChase
- Gallery Administrator
- Gallery Browser
- Honda Fit Top Videos
- Widget Converter
- Yahoo! Music Unlimited

In addition, I built lots of personal widgets:

- B-Spec Grinder
- Can't Wait
- Compact Suite
- Desk Calendar
- Hash-Slinging Slasher
- Kitty Clock
- Micro Suite
- Permissions Doctor
- World Clock Pro

At Yahoo!, I wore many hats. Some days I would curate third-party widgets for the Widget Gallery (a precursor to today's App Stores). Other days, I'd be designing and building webpages about and for Konfabulator. Occasionally I would serve as moderator for the Konfabulator forums. Many days, I'd be designing and coding the widgets themselves.

Several of the Widgets I designed were for various brand integrations.

I also designed and built the official Widget Gallery widget. With it, users could install widgets directly, instead of needing to download them with their web browser.

Later on, Yahoo! branched Konfabulator out, partnering with TV manufacturers to bring widgets to smart TVs. One of the things I did as part of the TV project was create high-resolution weather icons for its weather widget. Arlo Rose originally designed this gorgeous set, but it was only large enough for the weather widget bundled with Konfabulator.

On a TV, these icons would be displayed in HD resolution, so I had to redraw them. I stayed as close as I could to the style from the original artwork, while adding lots of detail that would look great in 1080p and beyond. I had a blast working on this icon set.

Yahoo! was my first big gig, and I learned so much from working there. It was demanding but fun, and it gave me my first taste of what a career in tech is like.

My time as the Widget Gallery admin taught me a lot about frontend and backend web development. I learned lots of valuable lessons about web performance and security practices from the world-class engineering talent at Yahoo!.

Being such a junior hire, though, my most important lessons came from working with others. My colleagues were very patient with me as I learned and grew, setting the stage for many successful design roles at Intuit.
