## hello.rickyromero.com

This is the source used to compile my professional portfolio, [hello.rickyromero.com](https://hello.rickyromero.com). It's a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) app built with [react-three-fiber](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber) and [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/).

Image processing is handled by my custom visual asset server, [Lens.](https://github.com/RickyRomero/lens)

I used the font [Codec Pro](https://www.zetafonts.com/codec-pro) in the design. That's not included in this repo due to licensing concerns.

#### Develop

```zsh
yarn dev
```
